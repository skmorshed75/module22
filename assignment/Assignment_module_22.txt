The X-Shop application is designed to provide shop owners with a user-friendly platform to manage their customer list and send promotional emails to their customers.

Key Features:

Customer Management:
Shop owners can add new customers to the system by providing their name, email address, contact number, and other relevant information.

The app allows the shop owner to view and search the list of existing customers, displaying their basic details for quick reference.

Shop owners can update customer information, such as contact details or preferences, as needed.

The ability to delete a customer record is also provided to remove outdated or irrelevant data

Promotional Email Campaigns:

X-Shop offers a simple and intuitive email campaign creation interface.
